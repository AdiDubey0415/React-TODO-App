/*
1. What is to be done where?
2. What do we do in reducers? - Have to be pure functions
3. What do we do in actions?
4. Make api requests with actions
5. What do we do in react components before we dispatch an action?
6. Concept of multiple reducers, if needed and possible?
7. Finish the application
8. Demonstrate something simple with a simple example - how to remove local state and use redux in one component, how to remove passing of props and use redux using two simple components
